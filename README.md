## Welcome to FitPal

With this app, you can schedule out your workouts, change them up if needed, and look up new exercises or routines all in one spot!


### `Schedule`

The app contains a calender where you can alter the select the various days of the month. For every day you select, you're able to add activities that you plan on doing. Every day that you have activities planned is given a green highlight!

### `Adding and Editing Activities`

The add activity component lets you add an individual activity for the day you have selected. You can enter in the name of the activity, select the type from a drop down, and specify the duration using a slider.

If you feel the need to alter your workout, you can do so easily by going to the activity list and clicking the edit button. This allows you to alter all exisiting values and make your updates.

### `Searching`
This is one of the biggest features! Opening the sidebar on the left allows you the option of selecting the search tab. This tab takes you to a page where you can search for videos on youtube. These videos are workout oriented regardless of what it is you enter in the search bar, but you are free to search for anything. Don't know how to perform a proper deadlift? Give it a search! Got chest day scheduled and want a new routine to try? Give it a search!
